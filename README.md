# Swiss Real Estate Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the Swiss real estate market by scraping data from various real estate websites, focusing on rents and buying prices. The primary objective is to calculate buy-to-rent ratios in major Swiss cities and visualize these ratios geographically using choropleth maps. This analysis will provide insights into the Swiss real estate market, particularly beneficial for investors and researchers interested in understanding market trends and investment potentials in different regions.

## Objectives
- To scrape real estate data (rental and buying prices) from various Swiss real estate websites.
- To process and clean the collected data for accurate analysis.
